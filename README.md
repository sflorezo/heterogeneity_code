# Where we at?

I am trying to see if anything can be identified from pricipal components of holdings bilateral contrasts Cij. Main current work scripts are inside [src/heterogeneity_code/a_nport_portshares/assetcat_port_shares/](src/heterogeneity_code/a_nport_portshares/assetcat_port_shares/). This folder tries to build asset category level portshares to see if any interesting variation arise from it.
